# JSENN
(Java Simulation of Evolution through Neural Networks)

JSENN is a Java program to see the gradual evolution of behaviors by creatures in a simulated environment. The goal is to have an open-source simulation allowing people to experiment with different environmental and creature effects to see how it affects the development of various behaviors; these behaviors are manifested in creatures controlled by neural networks, which are inherited through creature reproduction with slight variation, theoretically allowing for a simulation of natural selection and a dynamic environment of creatures.
